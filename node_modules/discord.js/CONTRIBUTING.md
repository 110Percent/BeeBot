### Contributing

We welcome contributions, but we ask that you follow a few simple guidelines

1. Please check the indev branch to make sure the issue hasn't already been patched.
2. If the issue hasn't been patched, edit the files in the **src folder**
3. Prior to making the PR, build the lib files by running `grunt --dev`
